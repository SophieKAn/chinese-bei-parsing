# Information About this Project

This program was writtin in conjuction with a research paper for a course in Chinese linguistics. The research paper will not be published here but I will provide some context and summarize  what the program is doing.

## Context

The research question we were attempting to answer is the following:

### "How does the function of the _bèi_(被) construction very between short and long passives?"

In Mandarin Chinese, the word _bèi_(被) is knows as a "passive marker". It is used to indicate the subject has suffered an action at the hands of an "agent". A passive in Chinese is much the same as in English. It is like saying "The dog(patient) was hit by the car(agent)," or just "the dog was hit," as opposed to "The car hit the dog"(active).

	<patient> + 被 + <agent> + <verb> (+ <complement>)

A short passive does not specify an agent:

	<patient> + 被 + <verb> (+ <complement>)

The word _bèi_(被) is commonly associated with 

## What this Program Does

We wanted to write a program to analyze a corpus in order to recognize patterns of usage with both of these forms of _bei_(被).
