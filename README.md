# Information About this Project

This program was writtin in conjuction with a research paper about topics in Chinese linguistics. The research paper will not be published here but I will summarize some context and provide some information about what the program is doing.

### Context

The research question we were attempting to answer is the following:

##### "How does the function of the _bei_(被) construction very between short and long passives?"

In Mandarin Chinese, the word _bei_(被) acts as a passive marker, indicating that a "patient" has suffered an action at the hands of an "agent".

There are two different types of syntax that use _bei_, the **long passive** and the **short passive**. A long passive specifies the agent of the action, as follows:

	<patient> + 被 + <agent> + <verb> (+ <complement>)

A short passive does not specify an agent:

	<patient> + 被 + <verb> (+ <complement>)

### What this Program Does

We wanted to write a program to analyze a corpus in order to recognize patterns of usage with both of these forms of _bei_(被).
